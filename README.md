# statistical-analysis
This project analyzes cyclonic disturbance data using hypothesis testing. A sample is taken, and the sample mean is compared to the population mean using a Z-test. A Z-score is calculated to determine if the sample mean significantly differs from the population mean. Results are visualized with a histogram.
